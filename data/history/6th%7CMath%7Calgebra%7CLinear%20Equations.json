I know it might sound a bit confusing, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it clearly.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what a linear equation is. It's an equation where the highest power of the variable (like x) is 1. For example: 2x + 3 = 7. \n\nA simple way to solve this equation is by isolating the variable (x). To do this, we need to get the variable on one side of the equation, and the numbers on the other side. Let's use our example equation: 2x + 3 = 7.\n\nNow, imagine you have $3 that you want to add to a group of 2 toys, and this combination of money and toys should be equal to $7.

So 1x means we are using the variable 'x', and we already have a number 2 candies. So, if we have 1x candy (that we already know is x) we also have 2 candies (that we already know are 2). We need to find out what 1x is, it's like we need to find the value of 'x'.\n\nThe equation is: 1x + 2 = 5 \n\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation.\n2.
