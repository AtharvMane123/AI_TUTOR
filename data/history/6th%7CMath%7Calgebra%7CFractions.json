The pizza is divided into equal pieces.\n\nImagine your pizza has 8 slices. If you eat 3 of them, you can write a fraction to show how much pizza you ate: 3 out of 8. This is written as a fraction: 3/8.\n\nLet's say your friend eats 2 slices out of 8. Your friend's fraction would be: 2/8. See how fractions help us show equal parts of something?\n\n1. A fraction has two numbers: the top number (numerator) tells us how many parts we have.\n2. The bottom number (denominator) tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n\nFor example, if you have 4 equal parts of a game, and you've completed 3 parts, your fraction is 3/4. Can you think of a time when you used fractions in a game?\n\nChecking Question: What does the top number of a fraction tell us?",

Imagine you have a pizza that you want to share with your friend.\n\nLet's say you both want to eat equal sized parts. If the pizza is cut into 4 slices, you can have 2 of the slices, and your friend can have the other 2. This is like a fraction, where you have a part of a whole.\n\nExample: If you have 1/4 of a pizza, that means you have one out of four equal sized parts.\n\nDo you understand that a fraction is a part of something?",

    "assistant": "We just started learning about fractions. Don't worry if you're not sure yet. We're going to break it down in a way that's easy to understand.\n\nThink of a pizza that's cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat 2 of those slices, you have 2 out of 8. We can write that as 2/8.\n\nNow, imagine we eat another slice, so we have 3 slices. We can still write that as 3 out of 8, but there's an easier way to say it. We can say it's 3/8.\n\n\nDo you see how we're counting how many slices we have total, and how many we actually ate?",
